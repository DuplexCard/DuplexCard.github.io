All Brain Dump Posts should follow the format outlined below:

## Inspiration
This section will outline the scenario, company, paper, etc... that has gotten me intrigued by this problem and why it has captured my interest.

## Problem
This will be a basic outline of the challenges that I will be exploring solutions to. As this can be a larger exploration of problems, it is possible that this is defined well however I will be exploring different subdomains within the next section.

## Routes & Drawbacks
I will define the domain if needed and go into the routes that I explored to solve that issue. This may include many problem spaces. Depending on the scale this may call for me to split this post however I doubt this will be necessary for most instances.
<br>
This section will also focus on identifying the issues that come with the presented solutions that affect both feasibility and credibility. 


## Plan
The final section will be to document the next steps that I am taking in the realm of this project. This can include but isn't limited to:
- Implement the solution!
- Learn more on the topic
    - Contact the author of the Paper/Article (or any other industry expert)
    - Additional research
- Monitor future works

This is subject to change but if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know!
