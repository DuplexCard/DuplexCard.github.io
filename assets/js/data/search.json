This site is going to be dedicated to documenting my journey into the world of AI/ML (And basically whatever I am doing at the moment) Ihope that someday this blog can be something others can get value out of and eventually create a community of like-minded individuals. Part of this site will be geared toward “Brain Dumps” in which I just take an idea and document the routes I took in exploring the idea. Some topics you can expect are : Ideas for potential personal projects Solutions for problems I struggled with My journey Academic Professional Thoughts on Research PapersFeel free to comment your thoughts and reach out to me for a discussion. I would love to have a chat. I am glad to see you here and I hope you can get some value from this site!" } ]
