# Welcome to DuplexCard.dev!

This site was originally intended to be a portfolio showcase for me however, I am planning on taking this in a slightly different direction. This site is going to be dedicated to documenting my journey into the world of AI/ML (And basically whatever I am doing at the moment) I
hope that someday this blog can be something others can get value out of and eventually create a community of like-minded individuals. Part of this site will be geared toward "Brain Dumps" in which I just take an idea and document the routes I took in exploring the idea. Some topics you can expect are :
- Ideas for potential personal projects
- Solutions for problems I struggled with 
- My journey
  - Academic
  - Professional
- Thoughts on Research Papers


Feel free to comment your thoughts and reach out to me for a discussion. I would love to have a chat. I am glad to see you here and I hope you can get some value from this site!
